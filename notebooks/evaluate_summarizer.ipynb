Players appreciate its strategic gameplay, which some find deeply involving with challenging AI, while its retro, 80s-inspired graphics and grim, scary soundtrack are consistently lauded for enhancing the immersive experience. However, some users found the gameplay to be too simple, repetitive, and lacking content, leading to boredom after short sessions, and noted issues with menu optimization. Crucially, a significant number of players reported frustrating technical problems with game key authentication, preventing them from playing.

Players enjoy the diverse races, leader classes, and extensive exploration, which contribute to high replayability and an addictive \"one more turn\" experience, complemented by a fitting soundtrack and great atmosphere. However, a significant number of users report severe technical issues, stating the Steam version often does not run on modern operating systems like Windows 8 or 10, leading to unplayable frame rates or crashes. While some players managed to get it working on older systems or with specific compatibility workarounds, many reviews criticize the Steam release as non-functional and a scam due to these widespread problems and alleged lack of support.

Many reviewers enjoyed its amazing campaign, which offers good voice acting, storyline, and atmosphere. However, the game's most significant drawback is its severely diminished and often toxic community, making it difficult to find active servers or reliable teammates. Players frequently report issues with friendly fire, griefing, and accidental kicks, while also lamenting the lack of new content or Workshop support, which limits its long-term appeal for solo players.

Its linear level design and unengaging vehicle and turret sections are often cited as drawbacks, though some appreciate the core gunplay and the absence of health regeneration. Visually, the game is frequently described as dated or \"plastic,\" even after player-applied fixes, and the story receives mixed reactions, ranging from \"weak\" to a \"very good\" continuation of Quake 2's narrative.
